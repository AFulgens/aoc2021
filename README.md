# Advent of Code 2021

https://adventofcode.com/

**In case you want to solve the puzzles yourself, DO NOT browse this repository!!!**

*(This repository **contains solutions** and sample/challenge inputs from AoC 2021)*

Implementation in Java (because I like the language, in 17 with preview feature, because just because) by me.

Just for fun, not for golfing or optimising or learning or anything.
